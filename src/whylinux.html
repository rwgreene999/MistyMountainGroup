        <p>In an era of increasing digital surveillance, I've embarked on a journey to switch to Linux, primarily driven
            by
            privacy concerns and a desire for greater control over my computing environment.</p>

        ℹ️ Why I think Microsoft is changing their attitude towards user privacy
    </button>

    <div id="MicrosoftDilemma" class="extendedComment">
        <p>Over the years, Microsoft has become increasingly invasive in its data collection practices. The tipping
            point
            for me came when purchasing a new computer:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mandatory Microsoft account</strong>: Despite being labeled as optional, creating a Microsoft
                account was essentially required, granting the company access to my machine's data.</li>
            <li><strong>Local account hurdles</strong>: Even after setup, reverting to a local account to run my
                software
                proved to be a cumbersome process.</li>
            <li><strong>Recall</strong>:Recall claims to watch everything you're doing in order to better model you to
                help you out The problem is they're watching everything you do!</li>

        ℹ️ The Apple-inspired Shift
    </button>

    <div id="AppleInspiredShift" class="extendedComment">
    <p>To me, Microsoft's strategy appears to be inspired by Apple's ecosystem:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple's approach</strong>: Seamlessly integrated, user-friendly, but with a prescribed way of doing
            things.</li>
        <li><strong>Microsoft's emulation</strong>: Moving towards a similar model, exemplified by features like
            Microsoft Copilot on the taskbar, which runs continuously to offer assistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware integration</strong>: New machines are incorporating Neural Processing Units to efficiently
            run AI workloads, which Microsoft's Copilot will leverage.</li>

    <p>This trend isn't limited to Microsoft:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mobile ecosystems</strong>: Android, Samsung, and iPhone all engage in extensive data collection.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Smart TVs</strong>: Manufacturers monitor viewing habits under the guise of personalization.</li>
        <li><strong>Automobile</strong>: Your auto is one of the most privacy invasive devices out there.

    <div id="LinuxAutonomy" class="extendedComment">
    <p>Linux offers users more control over their digital lives:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chosen distribution</strong>: Linux Mint, which provides a familiar Windows-like interface to ease
            the transition.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-installed FOSS apps</strong>: Ready-to-use free open-source software for common tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Customization potential</strong>: As users become more comfortable, they can fine-tune the OS to
            their preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning curve</strong>: Leveraging AI to navigate technical aspects, such as installing software
            like 7-Zip.</li>

    ℹ️ The Transition Process, How you use your computer What level computer user are you? 
</button>  
<div id="TransitionProcess" class="extendedComment">

    <p>The effort to transition into Linux depends on how you use your computer. I've kind of loosely divided it into three levels listed below.</p>
<p> <strong>Level 1: </strong>The transition to Linux can be daunting to people at first period to some degree it depends on how you actually use your computer
    If you use your computer to log in to your bank, watch Youtube videos or Netflix, and most of your work is done on the Internet, it's going to be really easy to go to Linux. </p>
    <p><strong>Level 2: </strong>If you work on your desktop such as using Office products, photo editing, etc then you might want to test your workflow before you commit your main machine to using Linux.  
    Products exist in Linux to accomplish the same tasks you would expect from Windows but some might require some additional training. 
    For example GIMP works as well as Photoshop for photo editing but you will have to get used to GIMP's way of doing things.
    <p><strong>Level 3: </strong>Using your computer for software development or CAD requires that you learn how to accomplish these same goals in Linux before you commit 100% to it. </p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Choose a Linux distro </strong>
        <p>
        There are many Linux Distros (distributions).  
        Since this is an overview of migration from Windows, I am focused on a few solutions which work well on most machines.  
        <ul>
            <li>Linux Mint (cinnamon) </li>
            <li>Zorin OS</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-linux-distros-for-beginners-in-2025-make-switching-from-macos-or-windows-easy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-linux-distros-for-beginners-in-2025-make-switching-from-macos-or-windows-easy/</a>
                </li>
                <li>These products will install a Linux similar to Windows.  Mint installs everything the average level 1 and level 2 user would need.  Zorin installs many of these apps also. And if you don't like the office products that come with Zorin or Mint, you can always install the free alternatives (example alternatives to Microsoft Office are LibreOffice, Apache OpenOffice, Calligra Office, FreeOffice,and KOffice).  You find these things by google, search: Microsoft Office Alternative or search: Photoshop alternatives for linux </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li><strong>Test from a Flash drive.  </strong>>
        <p> If you have an older machine, you can just install on it.  
            Otherwise, you might want to install onto a flash drive and test your machine from the USB. 
            The benefit of this is you maintain your real operating system until you're ready to commit to your Linux distro </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Two videos showing the installation of Mint on a flash drive</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNroapFEiKU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNroapFEiKU</a>   </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBC72byLDAA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBC72byLDAA</a>   </li>
            </ul>
            <p> If you are used to working with virtual machines coming you could do all this on a virtual machine instead of a USB.</p>
    </li>    
    <p></p>
    <li>Boot from the USB</li>
    <p> Once you have your Linux distro installed on a flash drive, you can boot from the USB to test your machine.  
        Here are some things to consider when booting from a USB:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Some machines will boot from the USB if it is plugged in, other machines require you to enter UEFI (BIOS) F12 or F2 whatever your machine docs say</li>
        <li>Some machines have a <strong>Secure Boot</strong> feature which you will have to disable if you want to boot from the USB</li>
        <li>Once you get past the issues above, and boot, you will be looking at the login screen for your Linux distro</li>
        <li>You can test everything to make sure your computer works as expected (sound, USB access, external monitors, ...)</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p> 

        <li>Finally Secure your Linux machine</li>
    <p>Unlike Windows and Apple which installs with a firewall, you WILL need to activate the firewall and other security for your linux. 
        Linux is more secure and more private, but only if you turn it on. 
        <p>Just follow this Chris Titus video, on how and why to secure your Linux machine.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxNsyrftJ8I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxNsyrftJ8I</a>

    </p>

        <li>BACK UP YOUR DATA BEFORE INSTALLING OVER YOUR MACHINE</li>
    <p>Before replacing Windows on your primary machine with Linux back up your data.  You can back up your movies and pictures and documents to a USB or an external drive or a cloud backup or your backup machine or whatever you choose.  Just make sure you got it back </p>

    <p> In my case I had my hard drive partitioned. My data files, my movies, my music, my pictures, were on a different partition from my Linux to be operating system drive.  And I still had a backup just in case.</p>

    <p> It doesn't really matter how good your computer or your phone is. It will break. Always have backups I followed the 321 backup process. Three copies on tww medoa and one off site. </p>

<h2>Transition Steps </h2>
<button id="showTransitionSteps" class="mybutton" onclick="showExtended('TransitionSteps')">
    ℹ️ My Transition Steps, what I did!
</button>   
<div id="TransitionSteps" class="extendedComment">
    <p>This is the process I implemented to switch to Linux:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> I pick a Linux Distro (distribution).  In my case I picked Linux Mint Cinnamon. 
        It comes with a windows like interface and tools like browser and office type products read to use. </li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tested on several machines.  These days most Distros work on most machines.  But I put Mint put it on a flash drive, boot to the flash drive and tested my machine.</li>   
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>Once I decided it would work, I installed on the hard drive replacing windows. </li>
</ul>
<p>Easy as 1-2-3!  </p>
<p> To some degree it really is easy as 123. When you get into more complex environment like multiple machines such as I have, there were other considerations which I had to address.  For information and how to instructions, I used AIs.  I would use perplexity or copilot and just ask them questions such as "in Windows I do a dir command to get a list of folders how do I do that in Mint?".  Or question like "I want to watch videos downloaded onto my Linux.  What do I do?".  That led into more complex questions such as "I want to access shared media from one of my Windows machines how do I do that in Mint?"  Some of these things trivial to implement, it just takes a lot of effort and a lot of asking questions.</p>

<p> But what I did all of this on an old laptop that would not upgrade to Windows 11 so that laptop now has Linux Mint running full time. 
    I've installed all of my tools on it. 
    I can check email I can go browse the Internet I can access shares inside of my house. 
    I can update this web page, using vs Code on Linux, BUT I doubt I can create windows programs on Linux.
</p>
<p>My next steps is to place all of my media and shared data accessed from the Mint machines.  Then the laptops can be Windows or Mint.  Afterwards I will kill all of myWindwos and just use Mint. </p>

</div>




    <p>By choosing Linux, I'm taking a stand for digital privacy and reclaiming control over my computing experience.
        While the transition requires effort, the long-term benefits of enhanced privacy and customization make it a
        worthwhile endeavor.</p>
