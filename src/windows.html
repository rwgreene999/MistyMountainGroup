        <h3>My Windows Defender Usage </h3>
        <p>I’ve done this safely on multiple windows machines for years. Once in a while, I will download something that
            tags as a problem. I trust Defender knows what it is doing. There are a few items that I keep which cause
            Defender to get upset. These are special geek tools which the normal person should not be using. I inform
            Defender to ignore items in those folders.
        </p>

        <p>
            Several times when I suspected a problem, I would download <a
                href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">MalwareBytes</a>. It
            has not found anything that Defender missed, except once. That problem was not a downloaded program, it was
            something running in my browser from a webpage whos tab I left open. It was utilizing my GPU to mine bitcoins. I
            killed the browser and Bitwarden deleted a temporary file.  it probably would have been deleted as soon as I closed the browser anyway.  But I felt better!
        </p>

        <h3>The Kaspersky rumor</h3>
        <p>
            You may have heard that the US government suspected Kaspersky, a Russian based anti-virus company, was
            spying on you. They banned the product from the US. There is a rumor floating around that the real issue is
            that Kaspersky caught some malware that the NSA produced to spy on foreign governments. The NSA was pissed,
            which resulted in the Kaspersky ban. There is no proof, just speculation.

        <h2>Removing Pre-installed Antivirus</h2>
    
        <p>New machines often come with pre-installed antivirus software like Norton or McAfee. These are typically
        resource-intensive and free for a limited time, then they want money from you. It's recommended to remove these and activate Windows
        Security from Microsoft instead.</p>



    <h2>BitLocker: Encrypt Your Data</h2>
    <p>BitLocker encrypts your hard drive or SSD, securing your data even if the storage device is removed from your
        computer. To use BitLocker:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You'll need a Microsoft account</li>
        <li>Encrypt your drive, save your recover codes somewhere else than your drive</li>
        <li>Your data remains inaccessible without your password, even if the drive is removed from yoru machine</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Account Security</h2>
    <p>Consider the following for your WIndows machine's security:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create and use a local account for main work instead of a Microsoft account</li>
        <li>Be cautious with biometric security like Windows Hello</li>
        <li><i>Personally, I don't like biometrics, does your fingerprint work if you cut your hand? does you face
                work if you have a fever? If you are passout drunk, will you wake you the next day finding out someone
                used
                your face to log in and order 20 pizzas? </i></li>
        <li> Will the government hold your phone or windows up to your face to log into your account and see what you're saying about the current administration?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Browser Security</h2>
    <p>Browsers are your gateway to the internet. To enhance browser security:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Install the uBlock Origin extension to block ads and enhance privacy, even the NSA suggest using an ad
            blocker</li>
            <ul><li> Google Chrome and Chrome based browsers now block uBlock.</li>
                <li> It still works on other browsers like Brave and Firefox </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Use multiple browsers for different purposes:
            <ul>Something like this: 
                <li>Edge for Microsoft services</li>
                <li>Chrome for chat applications</li>
                <li>Vivaldi for Amazon</li>
                <li>Brave for general browsing</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If you prefer using a single browser, consider Mullvad, Brave or Firefox. Change the default search engine to
            DuckDuckGo or some other privacy respecting search engine.</li>
    </ol>
