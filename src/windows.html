            <p> Microsoft Security is a fine product for home and light business needs.
                I find that many product reviewers do not review this when comparison to other anti-malware products.
                It offers:

                <h3>My Windows Security Usage </h3>
                <p>I’ve done this safely on multiple windows machines for years.
                    Occasionally, I will download something that Defender tags as a problem.
                    I trust that MS Security knows what it is doing.
                    There are a few items that I keep which cause MS Security to react.
                    These are special geek tools which the average person would not be using.
                    If I trust the source, I’ll inform Defender to ignore items in those folders.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Several times when I suspected I had a problem,
                    I would download a free copy of
                    <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MalwareBytes</a>.
                    Only once has it found a problem that Defender missed.
                    That problem was not a downloaded program, it was something running in my browser from a webpage
                    whose tab I left open. Perhaps it was utilizing my GPU to mine bitcoins.
                    Whatever, I killed the browser and Malwarebytes deleted a temporary file.
                    It probably would have been deleted as soon as I closed the browser anyway.
                    But I felt better!

        <h2>Removing Pre-installed Antivirus</h2>
        <p>Just bought a computer? Mosty likely it comes with a pre-installed antivirus program. Consider removing it in
            favor of Microsoft Security.</p>
        <button id="showremovePreinstalledAntivirus" class="mybutton"

        <div id="removePreinstalledAntivirus" class='extendedComment'>
            <p>
                New machines often come with pre-installed antivirus software from companies such as Norton or McAfee.
                These companies pay to have their product preinstalled on new machines.
                In my experience and in my opinion, these are typically resource-intensive and free only for a limited
                time.
                Once the free period ends, they want payments for continued service.
                I recommend you remove these products and
                and activate Windows Security from Microsoft instead.
            </p>

            <p>
                The last time I did computer, I simply uninstalled McAfee
                (Settings -> Apps -> Installed Apps -> search for McAfee -> “…” pick uninstall )
                Once I did this, Windows popped up and suggested I activate their Microsoft Security protection,
                which I did.

        <h2>BitLocker: Encrypt Your Drive Data</h2>
        <p>BitLocker is a technology to secure your drive from someone who steals your computer.
            If it's turned on, you need to take some action.

                ℹ️ What is a 'drive' anyway????
                <span class="popup-content">
                    A drive is a storage device like a HDD (hard drive) or SSD.
                    This is how your computer remembers everything after you power off your machine
                </span>
            </span>


            <p>BitLocker

                    <span class="popup-content">
                        Encryption is the process turning readable information into unreadable information, unless the
                        <i>key</i> is known.
                    </span>
                </span>
                your drive, securing your data even if your computer is stolen or if the drive is removed from
                your computer.
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>Is it necessary for you to use BitLocker?</i>
                If your computer was issued to you by a corporation, BitLocker is probably already installed/ You do not
                need to worry about it, that's your companies responsibility. You most likely enter a password at the
                power on of your computer before you really get started with a log in.
            </p>

            <p>
                If this is your computer, you need to <b>consider the implications of BitLocker</b>.
                If you keep sensitive information on your computer, especially if you travel with your computer, you may
                consider
                implementing Bitlocker.
            </p>
            <p>
                A new computer with Windows installed may come to you already with BitLocker encryption. When you set up
                your computer,
                Microsoft encourages you to create a Microsoft account and at that point they may ask to encrypt your
                drive,
                or they may just encrypt it. The BitLocker 'unlock key' is attached to your Microsoft account.
                You can add or remove BitLocker later if you want encrypt or decrypt your drive.
            </p>

            <p>If BitLocker is active on your machine, <b>you absolutely need to get the BitLocker Recovery Codes.</b>.
                Those keys allow access to your hard drive even if
                your machine fails, and you move your drive to another computer.
                Those Recovery Codes are also necessary if you
                need to reinstall Windows on your machine.
                And sometimes, you just have to use the keys to get back into your machine.
                To get these Recovery Codes you log into your Microsoft account and access
                <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/devices/recoverykey" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">https://account.microsoft.com/devices/recoverykey</a>
                Write down the recovery keys, and store them somewhere safe.
            </p>

            <p>To see if BitLocker is active on your machine, go to settings -> security & privacy -> BitLocker</p>

            TL:DR;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You need to use your Microsoft account</li>
                <li>Open Bitlocker Drive ( settings -> search for bitlocker ) </li>
                <li>If BitLocker is active, get your recovery codes (see above) </li>
                <li>If you decide to BitLocker your drive, this is your spot.</li>
