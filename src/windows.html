    <h2>Windows Security: Your Built-in Defender</h2>
    <p>Microsoft's "Windows Security" is a free, built-in tool that provides comprehensive protection for your Windows
        machine.
        It offers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anti-virus and threat protection</li>
        <li>Firewall</li>
        <li>Device protection</li>
        <li>Performance monitoring</li>
        <li>A few other services</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>My Windows Defender Usage </h3>
        <p>I’ve done this safely on multiple windows machines for years.
            Occasionally, I will download something that Defender tags as a problem.
            I trust Defender knows what it is doing.
            There are a few items that I keep which cause Defender to react.
            These are special geek tools which the average person would not be using.
            If I trust the source, I’ll inform Defender to ignore items in those folders.
        </p>

        <p>
            Several times when I suspected I had a problem,
            I would download a free copy of
            <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">MalwareBytes</a>.
            Only once has it found a problem that Defender missed.
            That problem was not a downloaded program, it was something running in my browser from a webpage
            whose tab I left open.
            That tab was utilizing my GPU to mine bitcoins.
            I killed the browser and Bitwarden deleted a temporary file.
            It probably would have been deleted as soon as I closed the browser anyway.
            But I felt better!

    <h2>Removing Pre-installed Antivirus</h2>

    <p>
        New machines often come with pre-installed antivirus software from companies like Norton or McAfee.
        In my experience and opinion, these are typically resource-intensive and free only for a limited time.
        Once the free period ends, they want payments for continued service.
        I recommend you remove these products and
        and activate Windows Security from Microsoft instead.
    </p>

    <p>
        The last time I did this, I simply uninstalled McAfee
        (Settings -> Apps -> Installed Apps -> search for McAfee -> “…” pick uninstall )
        Once I did this, Windows popped up and suggested I activate their protection software
        which I did.

    <h2>BitLocker: Encrypt Your Drive Data</h2>
    <span class="popup-trigger">
        ℹ️ What is a 'drive' anyway????
        <span class="popup-content">
            A drive is a storage device like a HDD (hard drive) or SSD.
            This is how your computer remembers everything after you power off
        </span>
    </span>

        <p>BitLocker
            <span class="popup-trigger">
                <strong>encryptsℹ️</strong>
                <span class="popup-content">
                    Encryption is the process turning readable information into unreadable information, unless the key is known.                     
                </span>
            </span>
            your drive, securing your data even if your computer is stolen or if the drive is removed from
            your
            computer.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>Is it necessary for you to do this?</i>
            If your computer was issued to you by a corporation, it is probably already done for you. If you keep
            sensitive information on your computer, especially if you travel with your computer, you may consider
            implementing this. One a windows machine, especially windows 11, the de-cryption key is installed in the TPM
            hardware thingy on your computer.
        </p>

        <p>
            A new computer with Windows installed, may come to you already encrypted. When you set up your computer
            Microsoft encourages you to create a Microsoft account and at that point they may ask to encrypt your drive.  
            You can change this later if you want encrypt or decrypt your drive. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether you choose to install Bitlocker, you should check the current status of BitLocker on your machine.
            Check if the drive is encrypted. 
            If it is you absolutely need to get the BitLocker Recovery Codes.
            Those keys allow access to your hard drive even if
            your machine fails, and you move your drive to another computer. 
            Those Codes are also necessary if you
            need to reinstall Windows on your machine.
            At this writing, you log into the Microsoft account and access 
            <a ref="https://account.microsoft.com/devices/recoverykey" target="_blank">https://account.microsoft.com/devices/recoverykey</a>
        </p>


        To use BitLocker:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You'll need to use your Microsoft account</li>
            <li>Open Bitlocker Drive ( settings -> search for bitlocker ) </li>
            <li>If BitLocker is active, get yoru recovery codes (see above) </li>
            <li>If you decide to BitLocker your drive, this is your spot.  Remember to back up your recovery codes (not on your machine).</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Account Security</h2>
        <p>Consider the following for your Windows machine's security:</p>
        <ul>            
            <li>Microsoft wants you to use their access for login to your computer</li>            
            <li>Be cautious with biometric security like Windows Hello</li>
            <li><i>I am not a fan of biometrics, does your fingerprint work if you cut your hand? does you face
                    work if you have a fever? If you are passout drunk, will you wake you the next day finding out
                    someone used your face to log in and ordered 20 pizzas? </i></li>
            <li>Will the law hold your phone or windows up to your face, log into your account and view your private comments?</li>
            <li>Microsoft desires to backup your work to the cloud, which is unencrypted</li>
                <li></li>
                
            <li>Solutions: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Create local accounts</li>
                <li>Store important file like your bank account pdfs in your folders, not the default folders </li>
                <li>At this writing, I don't know hwo to control OneDrive backsups, so I uninstalled it! </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>


        <h2>Browser Security</h2>
        <p>Browsers are your gateway to the internet.   
    <span class="popup-trigger">
        ℹ️ What is a 'browser' anyway????
        <span class="popup-content">
            A browser is a program like Chrome or Safari than enables you to log into websites and access data, informaiton and entertainment. 
        </span>
    </span>
        Most people in Widows spend the large majority of their time using a browser.  On phones we tends to use installed apps.  
        When using browsers, you need to pay special attemtion to information sharing without your knowledge.
