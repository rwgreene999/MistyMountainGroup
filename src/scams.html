<h2>The Rise of Modern Scams</h2>

<p>In today's digital age, scammers have become more prevalent and sophisticated than ever before. The shift
    from
    in-person cons to remote scams has significantly expanded their reach and effectiveness.</p>

<h2>Common Scam Types</h2>


<h3>The "Pig Butchering" Scam, both Romance and Crypto</h3>

<p>This scam originally targeted lonely individuals through romance schemes. However, with the rise of AI, it has
    rapidly expanded into areas such as finance, friendships, and the cryptocurrency world.</p>

<p>The hallmark of this scam is the cultivation of a long-term relationship, often developed over several months. AI
    technology plays a crucial role by enabling scammers to maintain highly personalized and convincing conversations,
    making the deception even more effective.</p>

        <li>When you respond, they engage in friendly conversation</li>
        <li>They gradually build trust and rapport</li>
        <li>Eventually, it moves to romance or get-rich-quick schemes</li>
        <ul>

            </li>
            <li>Crypto: They give you an opportunity because you are their friend, just invest in something for great returns
            </li>
        </ul>

        <strong>from someone trying to help their stepdad</strong>
        <p>Hey all I need help fast!!! My stepdad recently sold our childhood home and has been buying apple cards from
            Kroger! He is buying $1000 or more everyday and sending the scammer the codes! We don't know what to do
            because he won't admit it's a scam! This has been going on for years he's been sending his social security
            money to this person and struggling. He ended up with a little over $50,000 when he sold the house because
            he had to pay of the rest of the mortgage. This is what he has to live on for the rest of his life!! As
            stepchildren what can we do to step in legally?? I really need help as fast as possible!
        </p>

        <strong>No just old people</strong>
        <p>My husband was recently scammed out of 21000 Canadian in an investment scam. It was a trading firm he found on YouTube. The scammers have deposited small amounts of money back to him when he asked for it to pay bills. He got about 1000$ back total. I’m wondering what our next steps are? I just found out about this yesterday and I’m scared that his bank account and identity has been compromised. I know we won’t get the money back which is heart breaking because we are a struggling family of five with kids. Please no mean comments. He feels completely awful and was skeptical at first but the trade account looked so legit. Located in BC Canada.
        </p>    

        <strong>Someone about their Mother In Law</strong>
        <p>
                    I showed my MIL a law-enforcement website warning and picture of her scammer. She thanked me, “OMG,
                    what a fool I’ve been,” etc. The next day the scammer explained to her there was a conspiracy to
                    discredit him because his company owed Google money, and she kept right on swallowing it.
        </p>
        <strong>A Success Story, after $50 grand lost</strong>     
        <p>Had a good friend think they were going to marry Keanu Reeves. We got involved along with Adult Protective
            Services and eventually got a judge to grant my wife and my SIL as guardians over her. She has some medical
            issues as well, and is currently in an assisted living facility. She also has a disabled daughter that is in
            a facility as well. The daughter can manage most things on her own, minus shopping. </p>
        <p>We found thousands of dollars of used iTunes cards, as well as some PayPal transactions. All totaled about
            $40,000 to $50,000 that she paid out to these scumbags. They even had some of her passwords to Amazon, and
            gmail, so there were some things that they were doing on their own, until it got flagged and then access was
            shutdown. There were two different Paypal accounts that my friend had where we saw a lot of money going out
            in various increments, including $3000 to join the Keanu Reaves fan club. The scammers even had my friend
            send them a photo of herself and they send back this stupid looking digital fan club badge. </p>
        <p>My friend was in the IT field before she retired. So it was hard to believe that she would fall for this, but
            they were pretty convincing. We intervened just in time to prevent $30,000 from being transferred out of her
            Fidelity 401k. Now, Fidelity will only accept transactions via phone from my wife's mobile phone, as
            Internet access has been totally disabled. That gave us some piece of mind. </p>
        <p>They will go to any extreme you can think of to keep the scam going. </p>

            <h2>The Evolution of Bank Scams: From Door-to-Door to Digital</h2>

            <p>Long before the internet era, a sophisticated form of bank fraud known as the "bank examiner
                scam"
                preyed on unsuspecting victims, particularly targeting vulnerable individuals such as the
                elderly.
                This scam operated as follows:</p>

            <h3>The In-Person Approach</h3>
            <p>Two well-dressed men, posing as bank officials or law enforcement agents, would visit an elderly
                person's home. They would claim to be investigating a dishonest bank teller suspected of
                embezzlement.</p>

            <h3>The False Narrative</h3>
            <p>The scammers would explain that they needed the victim's help to catch the supposed thief. They
                would
                request that the victim withdraw a significant sum of money from their account, which would then
                be
                used as "bait" to trap the dishonest employee.</p>

            <h3>The Deception</h3>
            <p>The fraudsters would assure the victim that the money would be immediately redeposited, claiming
                this
                process would help identify the teller who was manipulating accounts.</p>

            <h2>The Digital Transformation</h2>

            <p>In the modern era, this scam has undergone a significant transformation:</p>

            <h3>Online Reach</h3>
            <p>Today's scammers no longer need to physically visit their targets. Instead, they exploit the
                internet's vast reach to contact potential victims through emails, social media, or fraudulent
                websites.</p>

            <h3>Wider Net</h3>
            <p>The digital version of this scam can target a much larger pool of potential victims
                simultaneously,
                increasing its efficiency and potential for success.</p>

            <h3>Varied Tactics</h3>
            <p>While the core deception remains similar, online scammers often employ more diverse and
                sophisticated
                tactics, such as phishing emails, fake banking websites, or social engineering techniques.</p>

            <p>The transition from in-person to online scams highlights the adaptability of fraudsters and
                underscores the importance of digital literacy and cybersecurity awareness in the modern age.

<h3>The "Verify You're Human" Scam 2</h3>

<p>The old verify you are human scam is going away because we NOW all know to never type in the number your
    bank/account/whatever sends you into some text box when someone ask you to do that.
</p>

<p>
    But there is a new version that takes advantage of the government's enforcement of you being old enough or web pages
    wanting to make sure you are human.
    It depends on you getting tired the verify you are human capcha or verify you are old enough, that many web pages
    force on us.
</p>
<p>
    It will encourage you to run thse steps: (1) Press the Win-R key, (2) Press Ctrl-V to paste contents into the pop up
    window and (3) press enter.
</p>
<p>
    If you do this, what you arereally doing is:
<ol>
    <li>Win-R - opens a pop up window to run commands</li>
    <li>Ctrl-V - will paste contents into the pop up window, that they preloaded into your clipboard</li>
    <li>press enter - runs that command </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
    If you do this, you just authorized some ubnknown command they created to run on your computer. This could be
    anything, but most likely will load spyware, and remote control software onto your computer.

<h3>Apartment rental application scam</h3>

<p>
This scam works when there is a shortage of affordable apartments for rent in an area. 
You will find a good deal on an apartment on a web site like craigslist or fb marketplace.  The owner cannot meet you because they are out of town.  They are hesitant to show you the place or maybe even give you the address for ‘safety reasons’.  But they need a deposit or application fee before allowing you to access the place. 
</p>

<ul>
<li> They don’t own the place</li>
<li>When get your deposit, they block you and your money is gone</li>
<li>An ‘application’ site will cost you and never produce results, plus they will get info like your SS number  </li>
</ul>
<strong>Protect yourself</strong> 
<ul>
<li>never deposit or apply for a place until you have seen it and know you want to live there</li>
<li>never deposit or apply for a place until met the landlord and can work with them</li>
<li>Use traceable money, like a check to make payments</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>General anti-scam tips for Protecting Yourself</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Never share verification codes with anyone.</li>
    <li>Be skeptical of unsolicited messages and unexpected relationships.</li>
    <li>Verify bank concerns directly through official channels (e.g., the number on your card or by
        visiting a
        branch).</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, staying informed and cautious is your best defense against these evolving scams.</p>

<h2>How to detect a scam web page:</h2>
<button id="showsscamDetectionExtended" class="mybutton" onclick="showExtended('scamDetectionExtended2')">ℹ️ Click me
    for example scam web page </button>
<div id="scamDetectionExtended2" class="extendedComment">

    <p>In this article, we'll examine a potential scam site discovered on September 30, 2024, and provide tips on
        how to identify such fraudulent websites.</p>

    <h3>Example Scam Site</h3>
    <p class="warning">URL: www.Joannst.shop Warning: This site may not be trustworthy for your money or personal
        information.</p>

    <p><img src="dist/images/ScamPage.png" alt="Scam Page" width="800"></p>


    <p>This site appears legitimate at first glance, featuring multiple entries, functional menus, and support
        for multiple languages. It presents itself as a liquidation site for Jo-Ann's, capitalizing on the
        company's reported bankruptcy process.</p>



    <h3>Why This Site is very suspicious </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It just feels wrong intuitively.</li>
        <li>The URL doesn't end in ".com" (always be suspicious of non-standard domain extensions).</li>
        <li>Prices are unrealistically low, often about 1/10 of the normal price.</li>
        <li>Prices are not listed in the standard US format.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Check a web page as a probable scam</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>(1) Use WHOIS lookup:
            <ul>
                <li>Ib browser tab, open: whois.com and enter the web name (in this case, "joannst.shop").</li>
                <li>Check the creation date and registrar information.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>(2) Verify the physical address:
            <ul>
                <li>Enter the provided address in Google Maps.</li>
                <li>Use Street View to confirm if the location matches the claimed business.</li>
                <li>In thie case, the street address was a gas station in Washington state</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>(3) Look for other suspicious elements:
            <ul>
                <li> for instance in this case those same items were for sale on the real joanne.com at the real price
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ol>
