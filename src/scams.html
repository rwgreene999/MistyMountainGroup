            These are a few recent stories (as in happened this week) that I found the day I was putting this web page
            together.<br><br>

            <strong>from someone trying to help their stepdad</strong>
            <p>Hey all I need help fast!!! My stepdad recently sold our childhood home and has been buying apple cards
                from Kroger! He is buying $1000 or more everyday and sending the scammer the codes! We don't know what
                to do because he won't admit it's a scam! This has been going on for years he's been sending his social
                security money to this person and struggling. He ended up with a little over $50,000 when he sold the
                house because he had to pay off the rest of the mortgage. This is what he has to live on for the rest of
                his life!! As step children what can we do to step in legally?? I really need help as fast as possible!
            </p>

            <strong>Not just old people</strong>
            <p>My husband was recently scammed out of 21000 Canadian in an investment scam. It was a trading firm he
                found on YouTube. The scammers have deposited small amounts of money back to him when he asked for it to
                pay bills. He got about 1000$ back total. I’m wondering what our next steps are? I just found out about
                this yesterday and I’m scared that his bank account and identity has been compromised. I know we won’t
                get the money back which is heart breaking because we are a struggling family of five with kids. Please
                no mean comments. He feels completely awful and was skeptical at first but the trade account looked so
                legit.
                Located in BC Canada.
            </p>

            <strong>Someone about their Mother In Law</strong>
            <p>
                I showed my MIL a law-enforcement website warning and picture of her scammer. She thanked me, “OMG, what
                a fool I’ve been,” etc. The next day the scammer explained to her there was a conspiracy to discredit
                him because his company owed Google money, and she kept right on swallowing it.
            </p>
            <strong>A Success Story, after $50 grand lost</strong>
            <p>Had a good friend think they were going to marry Keanu Reeves. We got involved along with Adult
                Protective Services and eventually got a judge to grant my wife and my SIL as guardians over her. She
                has some medical issues as well, and is currently in an assisted living facility. She also has a
                disabled daughter that is in a facility as well. The daughter can manage most things on her own, minus
                shopping.
            </p>
            <p>We found thousands of dollars of used iTunes cards, as well as some PayPal transactions. All totaled
                about $40,000 to $50,000 that she paid out to these scumbags. They even had some of her passwords to
                Amazon, and gmail, so there were some things that they were doing on their own, until it got flagged and
                then access was shutdown. There were two different Paypal accounts that my friend had where we saw a lot
                of money going out in various increments, including $3000 to join the Keanu Reaves fan club. The
                scammers even had my friend send them a photo of herself and they send back this stupid looking digital
                fan club badge. </p>
            <p>My friend was in the IT field before she retired. So it was hard to believe that she would fall for this,
                but they were pretty convincing. We intervened just in time to prevent $30,000 from being transferred
                out of her Fidelity 401k. Now, Fidelity will only accept transactions via phone from my wife's mobile
                phone, as Internet access has been totally disabled. That gave us some peace of mind. </p>
            <p>They will go to any extreme you can think of to keep the scam going. </p>

            </li>
            <li>There is a message about a large, suspicious transaction.</li>
            <li>It contains instructions to contact them immediately via a provided number or link.</li>

            <li>Do not use the contact options the caller provides such as a phone number or link.</li>
            <li>Contact your bank or credit card company directly, use the number on the back of the card.</li>
            <li>Or even drop by the local branch.</li>

                <h2>The Evolution of Bank Scams: From Door-to-Door to Digital</h2>

                <p>Long before the internet era, a sophisticated form of bank fraud known as the "bank examiner
                    scam"
                    preyed on unsuspecting victims, particularly targeting vulnerable individuals such as the
                    elderly.
                    This scam operated as follows:</p>

                <h3>The In-Person Approach</h3>
                <p>Two well-dressed men, posing as bank officials or law enforcement agents, would visit an elderly
                    person's home. They would claim to be investigating a dishonest bank teller suspected of
                    embezzlement.</p>

                <h3>The False Narrative</h3>
                <p>The scammers would explain that they needed the victim's help to catch the supposed thief. They
                    would
                    request that the victim withdraw a significant sum of money from their account, which would then
                    be
                    used as "bait" to trap the dishonest employee.</p>

                <h3>The Deception</h3>
                <p>The fraudsters would assure the victim that the money would be immediately redeposited, claiming
                    this
                    process would help identify the teller who was manipulating accounts.</p>

                <h2>The Digital Transformation</h2>

                <p>In the modern era, this scam has undergone a significant transformation:</p>

                <h3>Online Reach</h3>
                <p>Today's scammers no longer need to physically visit their targets. Instead, they exploit the
                    internet's vast reach to contact potential victims through emails, social media, or fraudulent
                    websites.</p>

                <h3>Wider Net</h3>
                <p>The digital version of this scam can target a much larger pool of potential victims
                    simultaneously,
                    increasing its efficiency and potential for success.</p>

                <h3>Varied Tactics</h3>
                <p>While the core deception remains similar, online scammers often employ more diverse and
                    sophisticated
                    tactics, such as phishing emails, fake banking websites, or social engineering techniques.</p>

                <p>The transition from in-person to online scams highlights the adaptability of fraudsters and
                    underscores the importance of digital literacy and cybersecurity awareness in the modern age.

    <h3>The "Verify You're Human" Scam Version 2</h3>

    <p>We all know about the "let me send you a number and you read it back to me" scam.
        Just about every wen site sending a text for 2FA will tell you not to give this number to anyone.
        But what about the new "verify you're old enough and you are human" where they ask you to perform a command on
        your computer.
    </p>

    </button>

    <div id="VerifyYouAreOldHumanExtended" class='extendedComment'>

        <p>
            This variation takes advantage of new requirements for age enforcement mechanisms that many web pages have
            started. As we become used to identifying ourselves as human and/or proving our age, we begin paying little
            attention to the actions. The inattention is what the scammer uses to take advantage of to install malware.
        </p>
        <p>
            In one version of this, you are requested to run a command on your computer without realizing it! You
            receive instructions <i>to prove you are human and old enough</i>. The instructions are:
        <ol>
            <li>Press the Win-R (Windows key and the R key)</li>
            <li>Press Ctrl-V (The Control key and the V key)</li>
            <li>Press Enter</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            Buy wait! If you do this, what you are really doing is:
        <ul>
            <li>Win-R - opens a pop up window to run commands</li>
            <li>Ctrl-V - will paste clipboard contents into the pop up window, that they preloaded malware into your
                clipboard</li>
            <li>press enter - runs that command </li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>
            If you followed these instructions, you just authorized some unknown command to run on your machine.
            This could be anything, but most likely will load spyware, or some remote control software onto your
            computer.

        <p>In this article, we'll examine a potential scam site discovered on September 30, 2024, and provide tips on
            how to identify such fraudulent websites.</p>

        <h3>Example Scam Site</h3>
        <p class="warning">URL: www.Joannst.shop Warning: This site may not be trustworthy for your money or personal
            information.</p>

        <p><img src="dist/images/ScamPage.png" alt="Scam Page" width="800"></p>


        <p>This site appears legitimate at first glance, featuring multiple entries, functional menus, and support
            for multiple languages. It presents itself as a liquidation site for Jo-Ann's, capitalizing on the
            company's reported bankruptcy process.</p>



        <h3>Why This Site is very suspicious </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It just feels wrong intuitively.</li>
            <li>The URL doesn't end in ".com" (always be suspicious of non-standard domain extensions).</li>
            <li>Prices are unrealistically low, often about 1/10 of the normal price.</li>
            <li>Prices are not listed in the standard US format.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Check a web page as a probable scam</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>(1) Use WHOIS lookup:
                <ul>
                    <li>In a browser tab, open: whois.com and enter the web name (in this case, "joannst.shop").</li>
                    <li>Who created this? Check the registrar information.</li>
                    <li>A recent creation date indicates a potential scam.</li>
                    <li>See Whois Data below.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>(2) Verify the physical address:
                <ul>
                    <li>Enter the provided address in Google Maps.</li>
                    <li>Use Street View to confirm if the location matches the claimed business.</li>
                    <li>In thie case, the street address was a gas station in Washington state</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>(3) Look for other suspicious elements:
                <ul>
                    <li> for instance in this case those same items were for sale on the real joanne.com at the real
                        price
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        </ol>

        <p>As we can see from the WHOIS data, this domain was created just 4 days before I found the page by a Chinese
            company, which is a
            significant red flag for a supposedly U.S.-based retailer.</p>
        <p>In this case, you could search <strong>Chengdu West</strong> and determine they are indicated in several
            other
            scams. </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
