<h2>The Rise of Modern Scams</h2>

<p>In today's digital age, scammers have become more prevalent and sophisticated than ever before. The shift
    from
    in-person cons to remote scams has significantly expanded their reach and effectiveness.</p>

<h2>Common Scam Types</h2>


<h3>The "Pig Butchering" Scam</h3>

<p>This scam originally targeted lonely individuals through romance schemes. However, with the rise of AI, it has
    rapidly expanded into areas such as finance, friendships, and the cryptocurrency world.</p>

<p>The hallmark of this scam is the cultivation of a long-term relationship, often developed over several months. AI
    technology plays a crucial role by enabling scammers to maintain highly personalized and convincing conversations,
    making the deception even more effective.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Scammer sends a message meant for someone else.</li>
    <li>When you respond, they engage in friendly conversation.</li>
    <li>They gradually build trust and rapport.</li>
    <li>Eventually, they propose get-rich-quick schemes because you are a friend, or they need money and you feel sorry
        for them because they are your friend.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <li> Another variation involves building relationship with a person </li>
    <li> To send nude pictures by sending new pictures of themselves </li>
    <li> Then they threaten you that if you don't pay, they will post those pictures to all your friends if you don't
        give me money </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Pig Butchering creates a fake relationship in which the victims often send money that they
    never recover.</p>

<h3>The Fake Bank Call Scam</h3>

<p>This sophisticated scam involves:</p>

<ol>
    <li>A call appearing to come from your bank (using spoofed caller ID).</li>
    <li>A message about a large, suspicious transaction.</li>
    <li>Instructions to contact them immediately via a provided number or link.</li>
</ol>

<ul>


    <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Contacting these scammers through their provided methods can lead to
        financial loss. Contact them directly, use the number on the back of the card or the local branch.

            <h2>The Evolution of Bank Scams: From Door-to-Door to Digital</h2>

            <p>Long before the internet era, a sophisticated form of bank fraud known as the "bank examiner
                scam"
                preyed on unsuspecting victims, particularly targeting vulnerable individuals such as the
                elderly.
                This scam operated as follows:</p>

            <h3>The In-Person Approach</h3>
            <p>Two well-dressed men, posing as bank officials or law enforcement agents, would visit an elderly
                person's home. They would claim to be investigating a dishonest bank teller suspected of
                embezzlement.</p>

            <h3>The False Narrative</h3>
            <p>The scammers would explain that they needed the victim's help to catch the supposed thief. They
                would
                request that the victim withdraw a significant sum of money from their account, which would then
                be
                used as "bait" to trap the dishonest employee.</p>

            <h3>The Deception</h3>
            <p>The fraudsters would assure the victim that the money would be immediately redeposited, claiming
                this
                process would help identify the teller who was manipulating accounts.</p>

            <h2>The Digital Transformation</h2>

            <p>In the modern era, this scam has undergone a significant transformation:</p>

            <h3>Online Reach</h3>
            <p>Today's scammers no longer need to physically visit their targets. Instead, they exploit the
                internet's vast reach to contact potential victims through emails, social media, or fraudulent
                websites.</p>

            <h3>Wider Net</h3>
            <p>The digital version of this scam can target a much larger pool of potential victims
                simultaneously,
                increasing its efficiency and potential for success.</p>

            <h3>Varied Tactics</h3>
            <p>While the core deception remains similar, online scammers often employ more diverse and
                sophisticated
                tactics, such as phishing emails, fake banking websites, or social engineering techniques.</p>

            <p>The transition from in-person to online scams highlights the adaptability of fraudsters and
                underscores the importance of digital literacy and cybersecurity awareness in the modern age.

<h3>The "Verify You're Human" Scam 2</h3>

<p>The old verify you are human scam is going away because we NOW all know to never type in the number your bank/account/whatever sends you into some text box  when someone ask you to do that.
</p>

<p>
    But there is a new version that takes advantage of the government's enforcement of you being old enough or web pages  wanting to make sure you are human. 
    It depends on you getting tired the verify you are human capcha or verify you are old enough, that many web pages force on us. 
</p>
<p>
    It will encourage you to run thse steps: (1) Press the Win-R key, (2) Press Ctrl-V to paste contents into the pop up window and (3) press enter.
</p>
<p>
    If you do this, what you  arereally doing is: 
    <ol>
        <li>Win-R - opens a pop up window to run commands</li>
        <li>Ctrl-V - will paste contents into the pop up window, that they preloaded into your clipboard</li>
        <li>press enter - runs that command </li>
    </ol>    
</p> 
<p> 
    If you do this, you just authorized some ubnknown command they created to run on your computer.  This could be anything, but most likely will load spyware, and remote control software onto your computer. 
</p>


<h2>Protecting Yourself</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Never share verification codes with anyone.</li>
    <li>Be skeptical of unsolicited messages and unexpected relationships.</li>
    <li>Verify bank concerns directly through official channels (e.g., the number on your card or by
        visiting a
        branch).</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, staying informed and cautious is your best defense against these evolving scams.</p>

    <p>In this article, we'll examine a potential scam site discovered on September 30, 2024, and provide tips on
        how to identify such fraudulent websites.</p>

    <h3>Example Scam Site</h3>
    <p class="warning">URL: www.Joannst.shop Warning: This site may not be trustworthy for your money or personal
        information.</p>

    <p><img src="dist/images/ScamPage.png" alt="Scam Page" width="800"></p>

    <!-- <p><a href="dist/images/ScamPage.png"><img src="dist/images/ScamPage.png" alt="Scam Page" width="600" /></a></p> -->


    <p>This site appears legitimate at first glance, featuring multiple entries, functional menus, and support
        for multiple languages. It presents itself as a liquidation site for Jo-Ann's, capitalizing on the
        company's reported bankruptcy process.</p>



    <h3>Why This Site is very suspicious </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It just feels wrong intuitively.</li>
        <li>The URL doesn't end in ".com" (always be suspicious of non-standard domain extensions).</li>
        <li>Prices are unrealistically low, often about 1/10 of the normal price.</li>
        <li>Prices are not listed in the standard US format.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Check a web page as a probable scam</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>(1) Use WHOIS lookup:
            <ul>
                <li>Ib browser tab, open: whois.com and enter the web name (in this case, "joannst.shop").</li>
                <li>Check the creation date and registrar information.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>(2) Verify the physical address:
            <ul>
                <li>Enter the provided address in Google Maps.</li>
                <li>Use Street View to confirm if the location matches the claimed business.</li>
                <li>In thie case, the street address was a gas station in Washington state</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>(3) Look for other suspicious elements:
            <ul>
                <li> for instance in this case those same items were for sale on the real joanne.com at the real price</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
