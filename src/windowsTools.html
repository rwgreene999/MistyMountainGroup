            The more features a photo edit provides, the higher the learning curve. 
            For simply editing the brightness or cropping a photo, the windows default editor work fine. 
            <br>For more complex editing, I use "paint.net" <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/" target="_blank">https://www.getpaint.net/</a>
            <br>For a professional editor, I recommend Gimp which is as good as Adobe Photoshop, free and has a high learning curve. <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">https://www.gimp.org/</a>

                    Edge will let you draw, type and sign a PDF.  Most people have little need to more complex PDF actions. 
                    Under no conditions would I install adobe reader.
                    <br>BTW: you can save most web pages as a PDF file.  You can view your bank's statement as a PDF and then save it.
