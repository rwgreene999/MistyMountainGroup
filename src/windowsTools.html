            The more features a photo edit provides, the higher the learning curve. 
            For simply editing the brightness or cropping a photo, the windows default editor work fine. 
            <br>For more complex editing, I use "paint.net" <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/" target="_blank">https://www.getpaint.net/</a>
            <br>For a professional editor, I recommend Gimp which is as good as Adobe Photoshop, free and has a high learning curve. <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">https://www.gimp.org/</a>

                    ZIP format is free from Windows, but 7-Zip does everything ZIP does, and can access other files also.  It tends to compress files better than Windows ZIP.  And it's encryption includes the file names.

                    Edge, Chrome and other browsers can safely open a PDF file. Chrome will let you draw on it.  
                    Edge will let you draw, type and sign a PDF.  Most people have little need to more complex PDF actions. 
                    Under no conditions would I install adobe reader.
                    <br>BTW: you can save most web pages as a PDF file.  You can view your bank's statement as a PDF and then save it.
