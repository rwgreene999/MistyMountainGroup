    <h2>About Misty Mountain Group: A Journey Through Code and Beyond</h2>
    <h2>The early days</h2>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Robert, and I'd love to share my adventure in the world of software development with you. It all
        began
        in high school when I caught the coding bug, and I've been hooked ever since!</p>

    <p>My professional journey started on IBM mainframes at banks, where I dove deep into assembler code. I loved how it
        connected me
        directly to the hardware's inner workings. During a stint doing performance and capacity planning, I created a
        tool
        that peered into the operating system's performance data. To my surprise, it won me a fancy Sony TV
        in a
        contest – quite the prize back then!</p>

    <h3>From Mainframes to PCs: A Pivotal Shift</h3>
    <p>Remember when microcomputers could only do one thing at a time? 
        If you are running word processor that's all you can do. 
        If he were running a calculator, that's all you could do
        Initially, I couldn't see 
        the PC appeal.  
        That is until I discovered a program called Sidekick. T
        his nifty program allowed you to pop up a calculator or notepad over your
        wood processor or game,
        giving me a taste of multitasking. 
        It was a game-changer that set the course for my career's next chapter.</p>

        <h3>From Mainframes to PCs: A Pivotal Shift</h3>
    <p>Transitioning to PC software development, I crafted a scripted method to connect PCs with mainframe screens for
        data
        capture. This led me to start my own company – a valuable lesson in realizing that great coding skills alone
        weren't
        enough to make a living. I found myself taking on various contracting gigs, including a couple at IBM.</p>

    <h3>The Human Side of Tech: A Challenging Learning Curve</h3>
    <p>My time at IBM taught me a crucial lesson: I needed to improve my 'people skills.' For the next 15 years, I
        excelled
        in system architecture but struggled to convince others of my design capabilities. Eventually, I retreated to
        gig
        work, feeling defeated.</p>

    <p>A turning point came when a remote gig at a large company turned into a job offer. Unexpectedly, I found myself
        promoted to tech lead and then team lead roles. This new chapter presented my greatest challenge yet: developing
        the
        people skills necessary to lead diverse technical teams and work with non technical business managers across
        different areas of the
        corporation.</p>

    <h3>Full Circle: Coding for Joy</h3>
    <p>Now, I'm back to where it all began – writing software for the sheer joy of it! This journey has taught me that
        while
        coding can be complex, mastering 'people skills' is truly the most challenging and rewarding aspect of a career
        in
        tech.</p>

    <p>I hope my story resonates with you and perhaps inspires your own tech journey. Remember, it's not just about the
        code
        – it's about the connections we make along the way!</p>
