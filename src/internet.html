        <h2>The Interconnection of Privacy and Security Online: Protecting Your Digital Life!</h2>

        <div style="text-align: center;"><i>It's not that I have anything to hide, it's that I have nothing I want to
                show
                YOU! </i></div>

        <h3>The Symbiosis of Privacy and Security</h3>

        <p>Privacy and security on the internet are inextricably linked, each reinforcing the other in a symbiotic
            relationship</p>

        <p>Consider how privacy enhances security: if malicious actors are unaware of which bank you use, it becomes
            significantly more challenging for them to target your financial assets.</p>

        <p>For instance: You buy a couch at the local furniture store. They require:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Phone number</li>
            <li>Home address</li>
            <li>History of items bought</li>
            <li>Payment information</li>
        </ul>


        <p>
            If the store is compromise by a disgruntled employee or hacker, 
            the bad guys gain access to your address, expensive items you bought, 
            and your credit card information.
        </p>

        <p> This is where privacy and security come together.
            <i>The less they know, the safer you are!</i>
            This applies to everything you do on the Internet.
        </p>

        <h2>Critical Areas for Privacy</h2>

        <h3>Password Security</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Unique password for each web page

            <h3>Why I Use a Password Manager</h3>

            <p>Long ago, I created login accounts for Yahoo, Google, Outlook, and a few others. I used the same user ID
                and password on all these sites to keep things simple. When one of those sites got hacked, the hackers
                automatically tried all the other sites—as well as several hundred other websites. They gained access to
                all of my accounts using that one password. <strong>Don’t do that!</strong></p>

            <p>These days, every website I use has a unique password. Each password looks like something unguessable,
                such as <code>mgm5Mnuv295NkE</code> or <code>n9zT4qN9Z67MLf</code>. These are practically un-typable
                passwords—I don’t create them, and I definitely don’t type them in by hand. I use a password manager.
            </p>

            <p>The password manager I use is called <strong>Bitwarden</strong>. They store, but cannot view, any of my
                passwords or sensitive information. Their software is <em>open source</em>, which means the code is
                transparent and security experts have reviewed it. They also hire an independent auditing firm to verify
                that their site and security measures are robust.</p>

            <p>I have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled, and I can access my vault from any of my computers,
                phones, or tablets. Bitwarden offers browser extensions for Safari, Chrome, Edge, and others—these
                automatically fill in passwords for banking sites and many other services. Even if I were to lose my
                home and all my devices in a disaster, I’d still be able to securely access all of my online accounts.
            </p>

            <p>At the time of this writing, Bitwarden offers both a free version and a very affordable paid version. I
                chose to pay for the low-cost premium plan, not because I needed the advanced features, but because I
                felt their excellent service deserved support.</p>

            <h2>When Picking a Password Manager, Consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption</strong>: Without strong encryption, your data isn't secure.</li>
                <li><strong>Zero-Knowledge</strong>: Even the company shouldn't be able to read your vault.</li>
                <li><strong>Recovery Options</strong>: You should have a secure way to regain access.</li>
                <li><strong>Company Trustworthiness</strong>: Do professionals in the security community trust them?
                </li>
                <li><strong>2FA/MFA</strong>: One password isn’t enough—look for multi-factor protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost</strong>: Value matters. Some free tools are excellent; others are not.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Some trustworthy password managers worth looking into include: <strong>Bitwarden</strong>,
                <strong>1Password</strong>, <strong>Keeper</strong>, <strong>NordPass</strong>,
                <strong>RoboForm</strong>, and <strong>Proton Pass</strong>.

        <h3>Email Management</h3>

        <p>Utilize multiple email accounts for different purposes
        <ul>
            <li>Personal email for friends and family</li>
            <li>Separate email for financial institutions</li>
            <li>Disposable emails for one-time registrations</li>
            <li>Consider Separate email for professional services</li>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <div id="EmailManagementExtended" class='extendedComment'>
            <h3>Email habits</h3>

            <p>Use a different email for your bank than you use for personal stuff. That way, if someone gets your
                personal email—maybe from a friend’s computer—they won’t be able to get into your bank account. Your
                bank uses a different email, so it stays safe.</p>

            <p>Some websites ask for your email before they give you information. Places like insurance companies or car
                dealerships might keep sending you emails, even after you’re done using their site.</p>

            <p>To avoid that, I use a separate email just for websites like those. You can make one for free at places
                like Google, Outlook, or Mail_dot_.com. You can also search for “disposable emails” online to find more
                options.</p>

            <p>I usually keep that extra email for a year or two, then delete it to stop the junk mail.</p>

        </div>


        <h3 id="WebBrowserInInternet">Web Browser Safety</h3>

        <p> On your computer and even your phone, much of your access to the Internet is by a web browser.
                <span class="popup-trigger">
        <i>ℹ️What is a 'browser' anyway????</i>
        <span class="popup-content">
            A browser is a program like Chrome or Safari than enables you to log into websites and access data, informaiton and entertainment. 
        </span>
    </span>

             This could be Safari or Chrome or Edge. These browsers tend to collect information about you for the companies that create
            them. Additionally many companies use technical tricks to track you. Using differenet browsers can be a good
            way to support protecting your privacy. Consider the following for safer browsing. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use privacy-focused browsers like Mullvad or Firefox or Brave
                <span class="popup-trigger"> 
                     ℹ️
                    <span class="popup-content">ex: google Firefox download, then install it. It will ask you to copy
                        bookmarks from your current browser.
                    </span>
            </li>

            <li>Change your default search engine to privacy-respecting alternatives like DuckDuckGo or Startpage or
                Qwant
                <span class="popup-trigger"> ℹ️
                    <span class="popup-content">Find settings (☰ or ⋮ or ⋯), look for "search Engine", pick a better
                        search engine</span>
                </span>
            </li>

            <li>Use different browsers for different activities to compartmentalize your online presence
                <span class="popup-trigger"> ℹ️
                    <span class="popup-content">Don't use the same browser for banking social media (facebook, twitter,
                        instagram). That limits informaiton that is shared behind the screens!</span>
                </span>
            </li>

            <li><button id="showBrowserSafteyExtended" class="mybutton"
                    onclick="showExtended('BrowserSafteyExtended')">ℹ️ More about browser safety</button>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div id="BrowserSafteyExtended" class='extendedComment'>
            <p><strong>Private browsing</strong>, or incognito mode, is not as safe as many people think. When you use
                private browsing,
                your computer does not save your search history. But websites and your internet provider can still see
                what you do online. At first, there are no cookies, but as you visit more websites, new cookies are
                added. These cookies and other tools can still track you, even in private mode. Also there is
                browser fingerprinting which is discussed below.
            </p>

            <p> <strong>Browser compartmentalization</strong>> means using different browsers for different things you
                do online. For
                example, you can use one browser just for social media and another one for your bank. If you use the
                same browser for both, social media sites can use cookies or special tracking to find out which bank you
                use. If you then search for art supplies, the social media site can know both your bank and that you
                like art supplies. They can also connect your phone number, your bank, and your interests. This
                information can be sold to stores or companies that buy data about people.</p>

            <p><strong>Options</strong>To help keep your information private, you can use browsers that focus on
                privacy, like Brave, Mullvad,
                or Firefox. You can also change some settings in your browser to make it more private. Here is a video
                that shows you how to do this:
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nl6hO0ECgM"
                    target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nl6hO0ECgM</a>.
            </p>

            <p> Remember, making your browser more private might make some things online harder. For example, you might
                have to log in to websites more often, or some things might not work right. I can do almost everything
                at my bank using Firefox, but I had to use a different browser in incognoti mode to order checks because
                it didn’t work in Firefox.</p>

        </div>


        <h3>VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)</h3>

        <p>Many VPNs say they will keep you private, but this is not always true.
            A VPN mainly scrambles, or encrypts, your data from your computer to the city you pick for your VPN.
            Some VPNs have extra tools that block some tracking, but you can also block tracking by adding 'extensions'
            to your browser. </p>
        <p>
            If you want to stop your internet company (the people who give you internet) from seeing what you do online,
            a VPN can help. Sometimes, a VPN can even let you watch videos that are blocked in your country.
            For example, using a VPN to watch a BBC show from the United States by pretending to be in London.</p>

        <p><strong>ALSO:</strong> Activate your VPN before logging into any public wifi site at coffee shops, hotel, or
            other places.</p>

        <p>What to look for in a VPN</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Doesn't keep logs</li>
            <li>Has a history of protecting user privacy</li>
            <li>Is especially crucial when using public Wi-Fi networks</li>
            <li>Avoid free VPNs, as they are using your info to make money</li>

            <h3>Best VPNs</h3>
            <p>This changes every year depending on cost and security recommendations. As I write this, the best VPNs
                are
                <strong>Mullvad</strong>, <strong>Proton</strong>, and <strong>NordVPN</strong>. a good source of VPN
                information at Techlore.tech's VPN site: <a href="https://www.techlore.tech/vpn"
                    target="_blank">https://www.techlore.tech/vpn </a>

            </p>
            <p>Other considerations include where you will be running the VPN, at home, on your phone, etc.</p>

            <h3>Public WiFi Security Risks and VPN Protection</h3>


            <b>The Threat of MITM (Man In The Middle) Attacks</b>

            <p>When connected to public WiFi, users are vulnerable to MITM attacks, where malicious actors intercept
                communications between the you and your intended recipient (bank, facebook, ...). This interception
                allows cybercriminals to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Capture sensitive personal information</li>
                <li>Steal login credentials</li>
                <li>Monitor online activities</li>
            </ul>

            VPN: A Shield for Public WiFi Users

            <p>To mitigate these risks, cybersecurity experts strongly recommend using a Virtual Private Network (VPN)
                when accessing public WiFi networks. A VPN offers several key benefits:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Encryption: VPNs encrypt your data, making it unreadable to potential interceptors.</li>
                <li>Anonymity: Your IP address is masked, enhancing your online privacy.</li>
                <li>Secure connection: VPNs create a secure tunnel for your data, bypassing potential threats on the
                    public
                    network.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>By employing a VPN while using public WiFi, users can significantly reduce their exposure to MITM attacks
                and
                other cybersecurity threats, ensuring a safer online experience in public spaces.</p>
        </div>










        <h3>2FA / MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)</h3>

        <p>
            MFA stands for Multi-Factor Authentication. This means you use more than one thing to prove who you are.
            Usually, it is something you know, like your password, and something you have, like your phone or a special
            code sent to your email. If someone guesses your password, they still can't get into your bank account
            unless they also have your phone or email. This extra step is what makes MFA more secure.
        </p>

        <ul>types of MFA
            <li><strong>link: </strong>This tends ot be an email link you click on to prove you are you!
            </li>
            <li><strong>SMS 2FA: </strong>This is a code sent to your phone. You have to enter the code in the app or
                website.
            </li>
            <li><strong>TOTP: </strong>Timebased One Time Password. This is a code sent to your phone or email every few
                minutes. You have to enter the code in the app or website. This code may also come from an app like
                Google Authenticator or Authy.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Passkey: </strong>This is a new method where your 'device' is used to verify you. In some forms,
                there is no passwork, just the passkey.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Hardware: </strong> Hardware keys are things you plug into your computer to validate that you
                have the key, something like a key to your front door.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Each of these MFA types have drawbacks and advantages. I will look at each in turn.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>link: </strong> Many people seem to acquit using email for various things. This link would
                require you to have an email access from your phone or browser or windows computer in order to click
                that link. Typically I don't run email on my phone so I have to be careful with these kind of MFAs.
            </li>
            <li><strong>SMS 2FA: </strong> Banks seemed to like this process, but it's really insecure. SIM swapping
                where someone steals your phone number means they'll also get these messages from your bank. If they
                already have your password then they can validate themselves with your bank.
            </li>

            <li><strong>TOTP:</strong>
                This type of login needs a special app called an authenticator.
                These apps are great for keeping your account safe, but they don’t always work on every device.
                For example, if you pick Apple’s app, it might not work on a Windows computer or an Android phone.
                If you choose Google Authenticator, it may not work well with an iPhone.
                An app like Authy works on lots of different devices.
                So when you choose an authenticator, make sure it can work on all the phones and computers you use, and
                that it can share the code across them.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Passkey:</strong> This is a new and very safe way to sign in.
                It uses something called a "device" to let you log in—like your phone, your computer account,
                or your web browser. Only that device can open your account, so you don’t have to type a password every
                time.
                It just connects by itself! But if you lose or break your device, that can be a problem.
                That's why some websites give you a backup, like a long code or 20 secret words.
                Make sure you save that backup, so you can still sign in if your device stops working.</li>

            <li><strong>Hardware: </strong> There's no guessing here. You have your key or you don't. The downside of
                using a key is they're pretty expensive and you've got to have at least two of them in case one breaks.

        </ul>

        <p>
            When picking an authenticator app for TOTP or passkey, consider these things:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does it work on all your devices?</li>
            <li>Does it share the code across all your devices?</li>
            <li>Does it have a backup code?</li>
            <li>Does it have 2fa itself?</li>

            <p>My solution to Authenticator apps
            </p>

            <p> I wanted to make sure my authenticator app would work across all devices, even my linux device. I wanted to make sure that the data it kept was stored in the cloud so if I had to go to a new device the codes would still work. I wanted to make sure that no one could get into my authenticator app except me.</p>

            <p> My solution to this was to use BitWarden. It works on all of my devices. The data that's stored in the cloud is not accessible by anyone except me without a password, and the password won't work unless you have, <i>and this is the extra security part</i>, the Yubikey. Yubikey is a physical key you have to plug into a device in order to access BitWarden.
            
            </p>
            Granted, I don't use the Yubikey every time I open BitWarden in my web browsers. A browser running on my computer is in my locked house and on my locked machine and is configured to require a password after 30 minutes of inactivity. The is considered safe by me. But the computers I take on the road, will always require the Yubikey before I can get into BitWarden.

        <h3>Signing up a new web site</h3>

        <p>When you sign up for a new website, it usually asks you for things like your <i>email</i>, <i>username</i>, and <i>password</i>. 
            Sometimes it also asks questions like <i>"What is your best friend's name?"</i> 
            or <i>"What city were you born in?"</i> 
            These are called security questions. They help the site check it's really you. 
            But here's the trick: don't use real answers! 
            Someone could guess them or find them online—like on your social media. 
            And never reuse your answers on different websites. 
            If one website gets hacked, a bad guy could learn your email and those answers and try to use them somewhere else.</p>

        <p>Also some of these questions have changing answer, like <i>"What is your favorite vacation"</i>, or <i>"What
                is
                your favorite movie"</i>. These change as you think about things, and do more things in your life.
                Just make up answers and safve them in your password manager. 
            </p>
        
        <p>If they ask your birthday, make up a new birthday for them. If they want a phone
            number so they can spam you, use 800.555.1212 (information). 
            If they want an email address and you doubt you'll ever come back to this site give them a disposable email . (see my email notes above)
            Save these answers in your password manager's comment section. 
            section. </p>




        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>By adopting these practices, you can significantly enhance your online privacy and security, protecting your
            digital life from potential threats.</p>

            <h3>Bitwarden and me</h3>
            <p>If you've made it this far, you'll know that I'm a passionate advocate for Bitwarden as my go-to password
                manager, TOTP generator, and Passkey solution. Like most password managers, Bitwarden seamlessly
                integrates
                with browsers and mobile devices, offering a smooth user experience.
            </p>
            <p>One place to have everything stolen????
                I project Bitwarden with a Yubikey, also I don't use an email account that you know!
                It takes an email, a password and a Yubikey to get into Bitwarden.
                Bitwarden will get me to everything else.
            </p>
            <p>There is a backup plan in case I lose both Yubikeys. You also create a fingerprint which you save outside
                of
                bitwarden in an encrypted file (or paper) and it is stored elsewhere. </p>
            <p>Without your unique email, master password, and Yubikey, cracking this encryption would require a quantum
                computer - technology that doesn't exist yet in practical form.</p>


            <h3>About Bitwarden</h3>
            <h4>Browser Integration</h4>

            <p>In your browser, Bitwarden springs into action, automatically populating login fields with your username
                and
                password. Need a TOTP code? It's just a click away. When a Passkey is required, Bitwarden politely asks
                for
                your permission before supplying it.</p>

            <h4>Zero-Knowledge Security</h4>

            <p>One of Bitwarden's standout features is its zero-knowledge architecture. This means that outside of your
                personal devices, Bitwarden has no access to your sensitive information. Let's break this down with an
                example:
                Suppose your password is "MySecretPassword".
                Bitwarden doesn't store this directly, it's not even sent between you and Bitwarden.
                Instead,it's encrypted into something like:
                "U2FsdGVkX1/nm1XL4XYhyR2kkSOhtKzQM9XaZpHDb81n57baOdg9fX03K5UrdpOJ"
                It cannot be unencrypted anywhere, except you by you on your device by logging in.
            </p>


            <h4>Other Outstanding Password Managers</h4>

            <p>It's worth noting that other reputable password managers like <strong>Proton Pass</strong>,
                <strong>1Password
                </strong>, and possibly <strong>NordPass</strong>
                operate on similar principles. The password management industry has generally converged on these best
                practices for security and usability.
                While I'm particularly fond of Bitwarden, I encourage you to explore other options too. The most
                important
                thing is finding a solution that you're comfortable with and will use consistently to enhance your
                digital
                security.
