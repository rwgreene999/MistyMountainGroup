        <h3>The Symbiosis of Privacy and Security</h3>

        <p>Privacy and security on the internet are inextricably linked, each reinforcing the other in a symbiotic
            relationship</p>

        <p>Consider how <strong>privacy enhances security</strong>: if malicious actors are unaware of which bank you use, it becomes
            significantly more challenging for them to target your financial assets. Consider how <strong>security enhances privacy</strong>:
            If a hacker can compromise your password but you have 2FA, they still can't get into your bank account.
        </p>

        <p>Information you give away online, and in person, is often used to identify you. For instance: You buy a couch
            at a
            furniture store. They require and maintain the following info: 
        Phone number, Home address, History of items bought, Payment information, hours you are home for delivery, etc
        </p>
        <p>
            If the store is compromise by a disgruntled employee or hacker,
            then the bad guys gain access to your address, expensive items you bought,
            and your credit card information.
        </p>

        <p> This is where privacy and security come together.
            <i>The less they know, the safer you are!</i>
            This applies to everything you do on the Internet.
        </p>

                <h3>Why I Use a Password Manager</h3>

                <p>Long ago, I created login accounts for Yahoo, Google, Outlook, and a few others. I used the same user
                    ID
                    and password on all these sites to keep things simple. When one of those sites got hacked, the
                    hackers
                    automatically tried all the other sites—as well as several hundred other websites. They gained
                    access to
                    all of my accounts using that one password. <strong>Don’t do that!</strong></p>

                <p>These days, every website I use has a unique password. Each password looks like something
                    unguessable,
                    such as <code>mgm5Mnuv295NkE</code> or <code>n9zT4qN9Z67MLf</code>. These are practically un-typable
                    passwords—I don’t create them, and I definitely don’t type them in by hand. I use a password
                    manager.
                </p>

                <p>The password manager I use is called <strong>Bitwarden</strong>. They store, but cannot view, any of
                    my
                    passwords or sensitive information. Their software is <em>open source</em>, which means the code is
                    transparent and security experts have reviewed it. They also hire an independent auditing firm to
                    verify
                    that their site and security measures are robust.</p>

                <p>I have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled, and I can access my vault from any of my computers,
                    phones, or tablets. Bitwarden offers browser extensions for Safari, Chrome, Edge, and others—these
                    automatically fill in passwords for banking sites and many other services. Even if I were to lose my
                    home and all my devices in a disaster, I’d still be able to securely access all of my online
                    accounts.
                </p>

                <p>At the time of this writing, Bitwarden offers both a free version and a very affordable paid version.
                    I
                    chose to pay for the low-cost premium plan, not because I needed the advanced features, but because
                    I
                    felt their excellent service deserved support.</p>

                <h2>When Picking a Password Manager, Consider:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Encryption</strong>: Without strong encryption, your data isn't secure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Zero-Knowledge</strong>: Even the company shouldn't be able to read your vault.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recovery Options</strong>: You should have a secure way to regain access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Company Trustworthiness</strong>: Do professionals in the security community trust them?
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2FA/MFA</strong>: One password isn’t enough—look for multi-factor protection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost</strong>: Value matters. Some free tools are excellent; others are not.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Some trustworthy password managers worth looking into include: <strong>Bitwarden</strong>,
                    <strong>1Password</strong>, <strong>Keeper</strong>, <strong>NordPass</strong>,
                    <strong>RoboForm</strong>, and <strong>Proton Pass</strong>.

                        I have Outlook, Yahoo, 3 googles and a mail.com account that I use for various purposes.

                    <h3>Email habits</h3>

                    <p>Use a different email for your bank than you use for personal stuff. this way, 
                        if someone gets your personal email, maybe from a friend’s contact list, 
                        it's less likely that can access your bank account.
                        Your bank uses a different email, so it stays safe. 
                        And if you get a 'bank' looking email on your personal email account, you know it is not really
                        the bank.
                    </p>

                    <p>Some websites ask for your email before they give you information. Places like insurance
                        companies or car dealerships might keep sending you emails, 
                        even after you’re done using their site. 
                        Once they are hacked, the spammers will use that email for years.
                        Insurance quotes in particular are actually selling your information as soon as you give it to them.
                    </p>

                    <p>I use a separate email just for websites like those. You can make one for free at places
                        like Google, Outlook, or Mail_dot_.com. I usually keep that extra email for a year or two, then
                        delete it to stop the junk mail.</p>
                    <p>You can also search for “disposable emails” online to find more options.</p>

                    <p> On your computer and even your phone, much of your access to the Internet is by a web browser.

                            <span class="popup-content">
                                A browser is a program like Chrome or Safari that enables you to log into websites and
                                access
                                data, information, social media and entertainment. For example, accessing a bank website
                                causes it to download the page view and javascript used to access their site.
                            </span>
                        </span>

                        Some browsers tend to collect information about you for the
                        companies that create them.
                        Additionally, many websites use technical tricks to track you. Using different browsers can be a
                        good

                                    When you use private browsing,
                                    your computer may not save your search history.
                                    But websites and your internet provider can still see
                                    what you do online.
                                    When you first go private, you have no cookies sharing.
                                    But as you visit more websites, cookies are added until you close the browser.
                                    These cookies and other tools can still track you, even in private mode.
                                    Also, there is <i>browser fingerprinting</i> which is discussed below.

                            <span class="popup-trigger">

                                    <strong>Browser compartmentalization</strong>> means using different browsers for
                                    different
                                    things you do online.
                                    For example, you can use one browser just for social media and another one for your
                                    bank.
                                    If you use the same browser for both, social media sites can use cookies or special
                                    tracking
                                    to find out which bank you use.
                                    If you then search for art supplies, the social media site can know both your bank
                                    and that you like art supplies.
                                    They can also connect your phone number, your bank, and your interests.
                                    This information can be sold to stores or companies that buy data about people.

                        <li>Avoid Browser Fingerprinting!!!!
                            Your browser has unique characteristics which allow you to be identified across multiple web
                            pages and devices.

                        <p><strong>Browser fingerprinting</strong>
                            In the old days if you went to WebSite-A for fudge, and then to WebSite-B for shipping,
                            a social media company called GC (because I don't want to name them and get sued)
                            can track your activity across those two websites.
                            They do this by storing cookies as you accessed those sites.
                            This way GC would know you were buying fudge and where you are shipping that fudge.
                            GC would use this info for new ads, or sell that to data brokers.
                            Basically they build a profile of your online activity fro selling you things and
                            manipulating you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They no longer need to store cookies because your browser provides a lot of information
                            about your
                            environment to websites you visit.
                            It turns out this is extremely unique information.
                            GC can now say oh we've seen that web browser before, they were at WebSite-A and WebSite-B.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is one of the reasons I suggest Browser Compartmentalization

                        </p>

                        <p> Remember, making your browser more private might make some actions online harder. For
                            example, you
                            might
                            need to log in or use 2FA into websites more often, or some actions might not work as
                            expected.
                            For example, I can do
                            almost everything
                            at my bank using Firefox, but I had to use a different browser in incognito mode to order
                            checks
                            because
                            it didn’t work in Firefox. My guess is that the check order process was a different site and
                            firefox security blocked the transfer of info.</p>

            <div id="AboutVPNs" class='extendedComment'>
                <p>Many VPNs claim they will keep you private, but this is not always true.
                    A VPN mainly scrambles, or encrypts, your data from your computer to the city you pick for your VPN.
                    Some VPNs have extra tools that block some tracking, but you can also block tracking by adding
                    'extensions'
                    to your browser. </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to stop your internet company (the people who give you internet) from seeing what you do
                    online,
                    a VPN can help. Sometimes, a VPN can even let you watch videos that are blocked in your country or
                    state.
                    For example, you could use a VPN to watch a BBC show from the United States by pretending to be in
                    London.</p>

                <p><strong>ALSO:</strong> I strongly recommend activating your VPN before logging into any public wifi
                    site at coffee shops, hotel, or
                    other places.</p>

                        VPNs
                        are
                        <strong>Mullvad</strong>, <strong>Proton</strong>, and <strong>NordVPN</strong>. A good source
                        of VPN

                    <p>When connected to public WiFi, users are vulnerable to MITM attacks, where malicious actors
                        intercept
                        communications between you and your intended recipient (bank, facebook, ...). This interception
                        allows cybercriminals to:

                    VPN: A Shield for Public WiFi Users

                    <p>To mitigate these risks, cybersecurity experts strongly recommend using a Virtual Private Network
                        (VPN)
                        when accessing public WiFi networks. A VPN offers several key benefits:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Encryption: VPNs encrypt your data, making it unreadable to potential interceptors. </li>
                        <li>Anonymity: Your IP address is masked, enhancing your online privacy. </li>
                        <li>Secure connection: VPNs create a secure tunnel for your data, bypassing potential threats on
                            the
                            public
                            network. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>By employing a VPN while using public WiFi, users can significantly reduce their exposure to MITM
                        attacks
                        and

            <h3>2FA / MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)</h3>
            More than your password, to keep them out

            <button id="showAbout2FA" class="mybutton" onclick="showExtended('About2FA')">
                ℹ️ More about using multiple factor authentication
            </button>
            <div id="About2FA" class='extendedComment'>

                <p>
                    MFA stands for Multi-Factor Authentication. This means you use more than one thing to prove who you
                    are.
                    Usually, it is something you know, like your password, and something you have, like your phone or a
                    special
                    code sent to your email. If someone guesses your password, they still can't get into your bank
                    account
                    unless they also have your phone or email. This extra step is what makes MFA more secure for you.
                </p>

                <ul>types of MFA
                    <li><strong>link: </strong>This tends ot be an email link you click on to prove you are you!
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Phone 2FA: </strong>This is a code sent to your phone. You have to enter the code in the
                        app or
                        website.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>TOTP: </strong>Timebased One Time Password. This is a code that changes every minute or so. 
                        You have to enter the code in the app or website. 
                        This code may also come from an app like Google Authenticator, Authy or password manager. 
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Passkey: </strong>This is a new method where your 'device' is used to verify you. In
                        some forms, there is no password, just the passkey.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Hardware: </strong> Hardware solutions are card readers or things you plug into your computer to validate
                        that you have the key, something like a key to your front door.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Each of these MFA types have drawbacks and advantages. I will look at each in turn.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>link: </strong> Many people seem to acquit using email for various things. This link
                        would
                        require you to have an email access from your phone or browser or windows computer in order to
                        click
                        that link. Typically I don't run email on my phone so I have to be careful with these kind of
                        MFAs.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Phone 2FA: </strong> Banks seemed to like this process, but it's really insecure. SIM
                        swapping
                        where someone steals your phone number exist.  This means they'll also get these messages from your bank. If
                        they
                        already have your password then they can validate themselves with your bank.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>TOTP:</strong>
                        This type of login needs a special app called an "authenticator app".
                        These apps are great for keeping your account safe, but they don’t always work on every device.
                        For example, if you pick Apple’s app, it might not work on a Windows computer or an Android
                        phone.
                        If you choose Google Authenticator, it may not work well with an iPhone.
                        An app like Authy works on lots of different devices.  My BitWarden password manager works on
                        all of my devices.
                        When you choose an authenticator app, make sure it can work on all the phones and computers you
                        use, and
                        that it can share the code across them.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Passkey:</strong> This is a new and very safe way to sign in.
                        It uses your "device" to let you log in, a device like your phone, your computer account,
                        or your web browser. Only that device can open your account, so you don’t have to type a
                        password every time.
                        It just connects by itself! But if you lose or break your device, that can be a problem.
                        That's why some websites give you a backup, like a long code or 20 secret words.
                        Make sure you save that backup, so you can still sign in if your device stops working.</li>

                    <li><strong>Hardware: </strong> There's no guessing here. You have your key or you don't. The
                        downside of
                        using a key is they're pretty expensive and you've got to have at least two of them in case one
                        breaks.
                    </li>

                <p>
                    When picking an authenticator app for TOTP or Passkey, consider these things:

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does it work on all your devices?</li>
                    <li>Does it share the code across all your devices?</li>
                    <li>Does it have a backup code?</li>
                    <li>Does it have 2fa itself?</li>

                    <p>My solution to Authenticator apps
                    </p>

                    <p> I wanted to make sure my authenticator app would work across all devices, even my linux device.
                        I wanted
                        to make sure that the data it kept was stored in the cloud so if I had to go to a new device the
                        codes
                        would still work. I wanted to make sure that no one could get into my authenticator app except
                        me.</p>

                    <p> My solution to this was to use BitWarden. It works on all of my devices. The data that's stored
                        in the
                        cloud is not accessible by anyone except me without a password, and the password won't work
                        unless you
                        have, <i>and this is the extra security part</i>, the Yubikey. Yubikey is a physical key you
                        have to
                        plug into a device in order to access BitWarden.

                    </p>
                    Granted, I don't use the Yubikey every time I open BitWarden in my web browsers. A browser running
                    on my
                    computer is in my locked house and on my locked machine and is configured to require a password
                    after 30
                    minutes of inactivity. The is considered safe by me. But the computers I take on the road, will
                    always
                    require the Yubikey before I can get into BitWarden.

                ℹ️ What to do for new web sites
            </button>
            <div id="NewWebSite" class='extendedComment'>
                <p>When you sign up for a new website, thay usually asks you for info like your <i>email</i>,
                    <i>username</i>,
                    and <i>password</i>.
                    Sometimes they also asks 'security questions' questions like 
                    <i>"What is your mother's maiden name?"</i>
                    <i>"What is your best friend's name?"</i>
                    or <i>"What city were you born in?"</i>
                    These security questions are used to help the site check it's really you.
                    </p>

                <p> 
                    But here's the privacy trick: <strong>don't use real answers</strong>!
                    Hackers can guess from your your social media or find these answers through previous web page hacks.
                    And never reuse your answers on different websites.
                    </p>

                <p>Also some of these questions have changing answer, like <i>"What is your favorite vacation"</i>, or
                    <i>"What is your favorite movie"</i>. 
                    These change as you progress in your life.
                    Just make up answers and save them in your password manager.
                </p>

                <p>Other questions they like to ask ...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Phone number: use 800.555.1212 (information) or their own phone number so they can spam themselves</li>   
                    <li>Birth day: make up a new birthday for them</li>   
                    <li>Email: Don't use your main email, use a disposable email or throw away email to reduce spam</li>   
                    <li>What is your favorite vacation? This changes as you progress in life</li>
                    <li>What is your favorite movie? Again, this will change as you watch more movies</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Save all of your fake answers in your password manager</p>

                <p>Exceptions to this rule:
                    <ul>
                        <li>if this is your bank, use real phone, DOB and email so they can find you if necessary</li>
                        <li>on web sites you visit often and if they use phone for 2FA, use real phone</li>

            <h3>Bitwarden and me</h3>
            <p>If you've made it this far, you'll know that I'm a passionate advocate for Bitwarden as my go-to password
                manager, TOTP generator, and Passkey solution. Like most password managers, Bitwarden seamlessly
                integrates
                with browsers and mobile devices, offering a smooth user experience.
            </p>
            <p>One place to have everything stolen????
                I project Bitwarden with a Yubikey, also I don't use an email account that you know!
                It takes an email, a password and a Yubikey to get into Bitwarden.
                Bitwarden will get me to everything else.
            </p>
            <p>There is a backup plan in case I lose both Yubikeys. You also create a fingerprint which you save outside
                of
                bitwarden in an encrypted file (or paper) and it is stored elsewhere. </p>
            <p>Without your unique email, master password, and Yubikey, cracking this encryption would require a quantum
                computer - technology that doesn't exist yet in practical form.</p>


            <h3>About Bitwarden</h3>
            <h4>Browser Integration</h4>

            <p>In your browser, Bitwarden springs into action, automatically populating login fields with your username
                and
                password. Need a TOTP code? It's just a click away. When a Passkey is required, Bitwarden politely asks
                for
                your permission before supplying it.</p>

            <h4>Zero-Knowledge Security</h4>

            <p>One of Bitwarden's standout features is its zero-knowledge architecture. This means that outside of your
                personal devices, Bitwarden has no access to your sensitive information. Let's break this down with an
                example:
                Suppose your password is "MySecretPassword".
                Bitwarden doesn't store this directly, it's not even sent between you and Bitwarden.
                Instead,it's encrypted into something like:
                "U2FsdGVkX1/nm1XL4XYhyR2kkSOhtKzQM9XaZpHDb81n57baOdg9fX03K5UrdpOJ"
                It cannot be unencrypted anywhere, except you by you on your device by logging in.
            </p>


            <h4>Other Outstanding Password Managers</h4>

            <p>It's worth noting that other reputable password managers like <strong>Proton Pass</strong>,
                <strong>1Password
                </strong>, and possibly <strong>NordPass</strong>
                operate on similar principles. The password management industry has generally converged on these best
                practices for security and usability.
                While I'm particularly fond of Bitwarden, I encourage you to explore other options too. The most
                important
                thing is finding a solution that you're comfortable with and will use consistently to enhance your
                digital
                security.
